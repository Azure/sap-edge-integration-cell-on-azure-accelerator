# SAP Edge Integration Cell on Azure Accelerator

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=773743527)

This repos serves as an accelerator for [SAP Edge Integration Cell](https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/setting-up-and-managing-edge-integration-cell) (EIC) on [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/what-is-aks) (AKS). It provides a set of terraform scripts and templates to automate the deployment of the required infrastructure and software components.

Scenarios range from hybrid setups like connecting a local ERP to SAP Sales Cloud, to complete on-premises scenarios like SAP PI/PO to ECC communication within a factory. EIC requires outbound internet connectivity for heartbeats and updates though.

> [!NOTE]
> Learn more about running EIC on validated hardware at the "edge" in your factory, plant, shop floor etc. with Azure Local (formerly Azure Stack HCI) [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-local/).
> AKS gets deployed to HCI via [Azure Arc](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/hybrid/resource-manager-quickstart). Adjust the terraform scripts to use the [azurerm_arc_kubernetes_cluster](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/arc_kubernetes_cluster) provider accordingly.
