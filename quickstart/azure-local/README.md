# Edge Integration Cell quickstart on Azure Local (formerly Azure Stack HCI)

ðŸš§UNDER CONSTRUCTIONðŸš§

Run SAP Edge Integration Cell (EIC) on validated hardware at the "edge" in your factory, plant, shop floor etc. with [Azure Local (formerly Azure Stack HCI)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-local/).

AKS gets deployed to Azure Local via [Azure Arc](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/hybrid/resource-manager-quickstart). Terraform scripts use the [azurerm_arc_kubernetes_cluster](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/arc_kubernetes_cluster) provider which is different from plain AKS.
